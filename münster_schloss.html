  <h1 align="center">MÜNSTER CASTLE</h1>
  <p>Münster Castle is of course a must-see when visiting Münster . It is a very good starting point for a stroll through the streets of the city. There are numerous sights in the immediate vicinity that you should plan some time to visit.</p>
    <h1 align="center">From prince-bishop residence to university</h1>
    <p>Münster Castle was the prince-bishop's residence until 1803. The architect Johann Conrad Schlaun built the Baroque structure for Münster's penultimate prince-bishop, Maximilian Friedrich von Königsegg-Rothenfels.
    The 91-metre-long three-wing complex with a five-aisle central risalit is elegantly designed using red brick and light-coloured sandstone. In 1945, the castle was completely bombed. Between 1947 and 1953, it was rebuilt according to old plans, at least in its outer appearance.</p>
